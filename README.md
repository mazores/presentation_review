# TRAA Midterm Review

Going over some stuff that almost everyone got slightly wrong. Not major stuff, so don't feel bad, but minor stuff we don't want to keep doing.

## Description

Fixing some common problems.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see caniuse for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including Babel for transpilation (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
